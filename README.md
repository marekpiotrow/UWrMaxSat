**UWrMaxSat** is a quite new solver for MaxSAT and pseudo-Boolean problems. It has been created at the University of Wroclaw and can be characterized as a complete solver for partial weighted MaxSAT instances, and, independently, for linear pseudo-Boolean optimizing and decision ones.

When citing, always reference my [ICTAI 2020](https://www.ictai2020.org/) conference paper, bibtex record is [here](https://www.computer.org/csdl/api/v1/citation/bibtex/proceedings/1pP3sSVh3BS/922800a132).

Since the version 1.3 you can merge the power of this solver with the [SCIP solver](https:://scipopt.org), if you have a licence to use it (see: https://scipopt.org/index.php#license). The SCIP solver will be run in a separate thread, if a MaxSAT instance is not too big (less than 100000 variables and clauses). Using parameters, you can force the solver to ran in the same thread as UWrMaxSat for a given number of seconds and UWrMaxSat will be started afterwards.

Since the version 1.4 you can use the solver as a library with the IPAMIR interface (see [IPAMIR](https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/2022/incremental.html)). Some UWrMaxSat parameters can be set in the environment variable UWRFLAGS, for example, UWRFLAGS="-v1 -scip-cpu=120". It works both with the library and with the standalone application.

Since version 1.6.1 the IPAMIR library runs the SCIP solver in a separate thread in the similar way as the standalone application. This default behaviour can be changed by setting UWRFLAGS="-no-par".

Since version 1.7.0 the default SAT solver is changed to CaDiCaL by Armin Biere.

### Quick Install

1. clone the repositories into uwrmaxsat and cominisatps:  
    git clone https://github.com/marekpiotrow/UWrMaxSat uwrmaxsat  
    git clone https://github.com/marekpiotrow/cominisatps  
    cd cominisatps  
    rm core simp mtl utils  
    ln -s minisat/core minisat/simp minisat/mtl minisat/utils .  
    cd ..  

2. clone and build the CaDiCaL SAT solver by Armin Biere:  
    git clone https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical  
    cd cadical  
    patch -p1 <../uwrmaxsat/cadical.patch  
    ./configure --no-contracts --no-tracing  
    make cadical  
    cd ../uwrmaxsat  
    cp config.cadical config.mk  
    cd ..  

3. build the MaxPre preprocessor (if you want to use it - see Comments below):  
    * 3.1 clone the MaxPre repository:  
        git clone https://github.com/Laakeri/maxpre  
    * 3.2 compile it as a static library:  
        cd maxpre  
        sed -i 's/-g/-D NDEBUG/' src/Makefile  
        make lib  
        cd ..

4. build the SCIP solver library (if you want to use it)  
    * 4.1 get sources of scipoptsuite from https://scipopt.org/index.php#download  
    * 4.2 untar and build a static library it:  
        tar zxvf scipoptsuite-9.2.2.tgz  
        cd scipoptsuite-9.2.2  
        mkdir build && cd build  
        cmake -DSYM=nauty -DSHARED=off -DNO_EXTERNAL_CODE=on -DSOPLEX=on -DTPI=tny ..  
        cmake --build . --config Release --target libscip libsoplex-pic  
        cd ../..  

5. build the UWrMaxSat solver (release version, statically linked):  
        cd uwrmaxsat  
        make clean    
        make r
    * 5.1 replace the last command with the following one if you do not want to use MAXPRE and SCIP libraries:  
        MAXPRE= USESCIP=  make r  
    * 5.2 or with the one below if you do not want to use the MAXPRE library only:  
        MAXPRE=  make r  
    * 5.3 or with the one below if you do not want to use the SCIP library only:  
        USESCIP=  make r  

### Comments:

   - the executable file is: build/release/bin/uwrmaxsat

   - if you want to use unbounded weights in MaxSAT instances, remove # in config.mk in the first line 
     containing BIGWEIGHTS before running the last command

   - The program can be compiled with mingw64 g++ compiler in MSYS2 environment (https://www.msys2.org).

   - To build a dynamic library you have to compile the static libraries above with the compiler option -fPIC  
     and, in the last step, replace 'make r' with 'make lsh'. The compiler option can be added to the steps above  
     as follows:  
       (2) The SAT solver library should be configured with the command: CXXFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure  
       (3) The MaxPre Makefile should be modified with: sed -i 's/-g/-fPIC -D NDEBUG/' src/Makefile  
       (4) Add the following option to the first line starting with cmake:    
           -DSCIP_COMP_OPTIONS=-fPIC
